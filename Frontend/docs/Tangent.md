# Tan - Tangent

Tangent function. Takes a number in degrees and returns its tangent. Due to floating point precision errors, values that should be zero are instead very close to 0. When writing minimal code, make sure to add at least one letter to the alias to avoid conflicting with the `tan` color literal.

## Arguments

```value (number)```
