A for each loop. Takes a word to be assigned each value in a list sequentially, then has a body that repeats for each value in the provided list.

If `fre` is provided a number *n* rather than a list, it will use the list [0, 1, ... n-1].

## Arguments
```name (word), list (list), st1, st2, ... (statements)```

```name (word), range (number), st1, st2, ... (statements)```
