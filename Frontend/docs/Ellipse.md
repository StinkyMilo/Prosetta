# Arc - Ellipse

Draws an ellipse centered at the turtle's position with a width and a height. The "absolute coordinates" override will move the turtle to the specified location before drawing. The rotation of the ellipse will be determined by the turtle's rotation. The width and height are the height of the maximum bounds (diameter in the case of a circle).

## Arguments

### Circle, Relative

```diameter (number)```

### Circle, Absolute

```x (number), y (number), diameter (number)```

### Ellipse, Relative

```width (number), height (number)```

### Ellipse, Absolute
