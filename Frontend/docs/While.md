# Whi - While

A while loop. If the condition (first argument) is true, all other arguments (statements) will be executed. Then the process is repeated, all statements executing until the condition is no longer true.

If the boolean condition is instead a number, the statements will all be activated a number of times equal to that number. 

## Arguments

```condition (any), st1, st2, st3â€¦ (statements)```

## Special Case

```repeat (number), st1, st2, ... (statements)```

## Example
<editor :code='`
